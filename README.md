## How it's made
This web app was lovingly crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a single event listener, you can uncover the name of your zodiac sign along with some fun insights.

## Lesson's learned
For this project, I had fun manipulating the DOM and seeing how JS and CSS can interact in fun and creative ways. For my next project, I'd like to learn how to make storing data, that is, creating and accessing the strings more efficient.
